					<p>
						I grew up in a bicultural French and Russian world, filled with kindness, creativity and a deep curiosity. From an early age, I was drawn to learning—reading and writing fluently in kindergarten and later being identified as HPI (high intellectual potential) in primary school. This led me to skip two grades, and by the time I was nine, I entered a semi-professional rhythmic gymnastics center in Strasbourg, where my life became a cycle of discipline and competition, making me, at times, hate the sport I loved.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						For five years, I dedicated myself entirely to the sport, winning multiple championships, including an international tournament and five national titles. But despite my success, reality set in. During middle school, I faced discrimination based on my ethnicity, and though I received offers to continue training in other countries, moving abroad on short notice wasn’t possible. I also had to confront a hard truth—even if I reached the European Championships and eventually the Worlds, there was no future for me in the sport. Women’s rhythmic gymnastics had little funding, no long-term prospects, and no real way to make a living from it. So, I made one of the toughest decisions of my life: I walked away.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						For the first time, I experienced life outside of elite sports. In high school, I channeled my energy into new challenges, throwing myself into an innovative youth literature project, which I launched through participatory financing. At the same time, I was accepted into Sciences Po Paris, and my world expanded in unexpected ways. During my exchange year in Canada, I stumbled upon something I did not expect to take such a huge place in my life and my self: boxing. Training in an old-school club, I found a new kind of discipline—one rooted in strategy, raw intensity, and mental resilience.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Six months ago, I also discovered a deep passion for League of Legends, drawn to its complexity and the endless room for mastery in strategical and mechanical skills. And after earning my Bachelor's degree, I knew I wanted to build something meaningful—something of my own. That’s what led me to programming. I chose Zone01 for its collaborative, hands-on approach—learning through doing, surrounded by people who are just as driven as I am.
                    	Now, six months into this journey, I feel ready to take what I’ve learned—not just the technical skills, but the resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving mindset I’ve developed—and apply it to concrete projects. I want what I build to help other people.
