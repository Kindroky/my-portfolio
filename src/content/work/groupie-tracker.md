#### Groupie Tracker — Visualize Band Tours and Data with Go

**Groupie Tracker** is a full stack web application built to turn raw artist and tour data into a beautiful and intuitive interface. The app connects to an external API that provides information about musical artists, their concert locations, and historical data, and presents it with dynamic client-server interactions.

Designed with both performance and clarity in mind, Groupie Tracker brings together backend logic in Go and a clean frontend for optimal user experience.

---

#### 📊 Project Overview

The core objective of **Groupie Tracker** is to make musical data easy to explore and engaging to interact with. It achieves this by providing:

- Visual exploration of artist profiles and history
- Concert locations and dates across the world
- Smooth client-server interactions triggered by user actions
- Fully functional Go backend using only standard packages

---

#### 🔗 The API Architecture

The project is structured around four key API endpoints:

- **Artists**: Contains each artist’s name, photo, activity start year, debut album, and band members.
- **Locations**: Lists the places where the artist has performed or will perform.
- **Dates**: Provides corresponding dates for each concert.
- **Relation**: Bridges artists with their performance locations and dates.

---

#### 🌟 Key Features

#### 🎨 Data Visualization

- Cleanly presented artist profiles
- Cards, tables, and other UI components to display relationships between bands, tours, and dates

#### 💬 Interactive Client Experience

- Users interact with buttons or filters that trigger requests to the Go server
- Data is fetched or updated in real time, keeping the UI responsive and fluid

#### 🛠 Go Backend

- Entire server-side logic is built with Go’s standard library
- Handles data parsing, routing, error handling, and client requests efficiently

#### ⚙️ Error Handling

- Designed to avoid crashes with robust fallback behavior
- Ensures reliability across all user actions

---

#### 🧪 Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang), with no external packages
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript
- **Architecture**: REST-style interaction between client and server
- **Client Events**: Triggers for data reloads and page updates based on user input

---

#### 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Working on this project has reinforced skills in:

- Data processing and transformation from APIs
- Structuring full stack applications
- Designing RESTful services in Go
- Creating interactive web experiences with minimal frontend tech
- Parsing and rendering JSON data effectively
- Managing client-server communication loops
- Writing stable, maintainable backend code with error protection

---

#### 🚀 How It Works

1. The Go server launches and connects to the API.
2. Artist and tour data are parsed and stored in memory.
3. The frontend displays this data using cards and tables.
4. Client actions like clicks trigger Go routes, fetching new data or updating the UI.

---

#### 🖥 Setup and Run

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Make sure Go is installed.
3. Run the server with:

```bash
go run .
```

4. Open the site in your browser to start exploring bands and tour data interactively.

---

#### Conclusion

**Groupie Tracker** was one of my very first projects in golang. It's a fully functional exploration into API-driven application design. Built with precision and care, it transforms structured data into a fun, clear, and usable product.

Perfect for practicing Go, understanding APIs, and building interactive interfaces without relying on heavy frameworks.
