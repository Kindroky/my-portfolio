#### HackerNews UI 

**HackerNews UI** is a frontend project designed to provide a smooth and real-time browsing experience for HackerNews content. From live stories to deep comment threads, this app dynamically displays the latest updates from the HackerNews API with performance in mind.

This was one of my first frontend-focused projects and helped me practice asynchronous data handling, UI responsiveness, and optimization patterns in client-side development.

#### 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of HackerNews UI is to give users an efficient and interactive way to browse HackerNews categories like:

- **Top Stories**
- **Jobs**
- **Questions**
- **Polls**
- **Comment threads**

Everything is fetched from the HackerNews public API and rendered in a user-friendly interface.
