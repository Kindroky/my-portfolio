# TCP Chat Server in Go

**Netcat-style TCP chat server** in Go. This project enables multiple clients to connect, send messages, and interact in real time, using Go's standard networking libraries.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Netcat-Style Interface**: Command-line interaction over TCP, mimicking the classic Netcat behavior.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Broadcasts sent messages to all connected users instantly.
- **Command Support**:
  - `/exit` â€” Disconnect from the chat.
  - `/rename` â€” Change your display name.
- **ASCII Art Welcome**: Retro-style greeting on every connection.
- **Activity Logging**: All interactions are logged to `logs.txt` for audit or debugging.
- **Safe Concurrency**: `sync.Mutex` ensures thread-safe handling of shared resources.
- **Multi-Client Support**: Handles up to 10 simultaneous users.

### Start the Server

Launch your chat server with a specific port:

```bash
go run . 2525
```

### Connect a Client

In another terminal window, use Netcat to connect to the chat server:

```bash
nc localhost 2525
```

### Connect Over Network

If using multiple devices on the same Wi-Fi, replace `localhost` with the host machine's IP:

```bash
nc [IP_ADDRESS] 2525
```

> All devices must be on the same local network.

## ðŸ§  Why Build This?

This project is perfect for learning:

- TCP socket programming in Go  
- Goroutines and mutexes for concurrency  
- Real-time message handling and broadcasting  
- Designing interactive terminal apps  
- Structuring basic backend services

Itâ€™s a compact, educational, and fun introduction to network systems.
